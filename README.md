
# Welcome to the SharePoint Usage Docs!

This repository is here for YOU. RThe goal is to build an open source set of content to help people like Information Architects, Business Analayts, "Makers" (aka Citizen Developers), and Site Owners who want to use the platform better.

There are lots of resources for developers, so that isn't our target audience. We may include some code samples or snippet of code in the context of getting something done, but for the most part , it will be to help facilitate conversations between the folks abnove and the developers with whom they work.
