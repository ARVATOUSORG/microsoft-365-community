# Introduction

This article talks about scalability of your solutions, this refers to this scenario - you have built your solution and tested on a site or library, you have demoed to your boss, they are very happy and then he goes "Hey now, great solution, can you get this out to 1,000 sites please?". The requirement has changed - to note it is best to ask this question early. So you have this new requirement, what kinds of points do you think about, when building your solution on this scale. 

# Considerations when building solutions at scale

You now have your solution, so lets go through aspects of the solution you should ask of your solution, to see if you need to make amendments, or think about its design.

# Centralised or Distributed

First question to ask yourself, do you need to deploy this solution 1,000 times or can you place a navigation link on 1000 sites referring to a single location?

Partial centralisation is an option too - deployment of solution to 10 sites, with links from the remaining location to these points. A scenario where this may apply, is if you have 10 departments each with 100 sites within.
