# SharePoint Usage Glossary

As with any technology, there are lots of terms we todss around to explain things. Just understanding what each term means can be helf the battle. Whether you are entirely new to SharePoint or have been using it for a decade, there are always bnew terms to learn. The fact that Microsoft uses common English workds for my capabilities can addd an additional layer of confusion.

This Glossary is an attempt to demystify some of the terms and acronyms we use every day in working with the platform. See one missing? Feel free to add an Issue with what you want added.
