# Importing data into SharePoint

This guide will help users import files and data into SharePoint.

## Document Libraries – Drag and drop files and folders (User)

SharePoint document libraries support the *drag and drop* of files and folders from computer to site. With the target site and document library open:
- Select the source files / folders.
- Drag to the site and release.<br>
