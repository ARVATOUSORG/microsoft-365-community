# Importing data into SharePoint

This guide will help users import files and data into SharePoint.

## Document Libraries – Drag and drop files and folders (User)

SharePoint document libraries support the *drag and drop* of files and folders from computer to site. With the target site and document library open:
- Select the source files / folders.
- Drag to the site and release.

Example *drag and drop* image shown below:<br>
![Drag and drop of files and folders from computer to site](../../images/importing-data/drag-drop-files-folders.png)

The upload status can be monitored using the “Show progress” button on the document library menu. Example “Show progress” button image shown below:<br>
![“Show progress” button](../../images/importing-data/drag-drop-show-progress.png)

The “Show progress” button will notify you of any errors and when possible provide an intervention. Example intervention image shown below:<br>

Example error image shown below:<br>

## Document Libraries – Upload files and folders (User)
Like the *drag and drop* of files and folders, SharePoint document libraries also support the direct uploading files and folders. With the target site and document library open:
- Click “Upload” and select “Files” or “Folder”. The “Files” option does not allow the uploading of folders. Similarly, the “Folder” option does not allow files. Example “Upload” button image shown below:<br>

- Select the source files / folders and click “Open”. Example source files / folders image shown below:<br>
![Upload files](../../images/importing-data/upload-files.png)

- The “Show progress” button will notify you of any errors and when possible provide an intervention. Example “Show progress” button image shown below:<br>

## Document Libraries – Copy to and Move to (Power user)
SharePoint document libraries support the copying and moving of files / folders to new locations. New locations can include a different folder, document library or site (including OneDrive for Business).

The “Copy to” feature will copy the files / folders to the new location while leaving the source files / folders unchanged. With the target site and document library open:
- Select the source files / folders and click “Copy to”. Example source files / folders image shown below:<br>
![Source files](../../images/importing-data/copy-to-files.png)

- Select the target location (i.e. “Your OneDrive”). Example target location example image shown below:<br>
![Target location](../../images/importing-data/copy-to-files-target-location.png)

- Click “Copy here” to complete the file / folder copy. Example “Copy here” image shown below:<br>
![“Copy here” button](../../images/importing-data/copy-to-files-copy-here.png)

- The “Show progress” button will notify you of any errors and when possible provide an intervention. Example “Show button” image shown below:<br>
![“Show progress” button](../../images/importing-data/copy-to-files-show-progress.png)


The “Move to” feature will copy the files / folders to the new location and will move the source files / folders to the site “Recycle bin”. With the target site and document library open:

- Select the source files / folders and click “Move to”. Example source files / folders image shown below:<br>
![Source folder](../../images/importing-data/move-to-folder.png)

- Select the target location (i.e. “Planning” document library). Example target location image shown below:<br>
![Target location](../../images/importing-data/move-to-folder-target-location.png)

- Click the target site (i.e. “Human Resources” site) and then click the target document library (i.e. “Planning”). Example target site and document library image shown below:<br>
![Target site and document library](../../images/importing-data/move-to-folder-target-site-library.png)

- Click “Move here” to complete the file / folder move. Example “Move here” image shown below:<br>
