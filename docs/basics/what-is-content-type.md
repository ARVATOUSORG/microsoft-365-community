# What is a Content Type?

## Basic Idea

The easy answer here is a Content Type is a type of content, but that isn't very helpful.

A content Type is like a business object: something that you move around your desk or computer every day.

## Real World Example

You work with Content Types at home every day. You probably have grocery lists, bills, and maybe a mortgage around your house right now. Each of these objects are second nature to you; you don't think about what they are or what to call them.

For sake of discussion, lets say you do have a mortgage and you've put it into a mnailla folder in your drawer.
