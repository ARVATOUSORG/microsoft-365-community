# Maturity Model for Microsoft 365 - Employee Experience Competency

[!INCLUDE [content-disclaimer](includes/content-disclaimer.md)]

![Maturity Model for Microsoft 365](media/maturity-model-for-microsoft-365/M365MM.png)

## Principles of Employee Experience  

Effective organizations need to have clear and effective strategies supported by ‘on the ground’ activities, combined with positive employee experiences and alignment.  

While this competency is titled Employee Experience, we recognize that employee engagement is a related concept, and these are often used interchangeably. While they are related, they refer to different aspects of the employee-employer relationship:

- **Employee Engagement** is the commitment team members feel to their organization, its central mission, and core values. It is about the overarching connection or relationship employees have with the organization as a whole. Employee engagement typically focuses on factors such as enablement, energy, empowerment, and encouragement.

- **Employee Experience** is about individual moments and interactions that employees have with their work environment. It encompasses the input from an organization, including what employees feel, see, and hear in their daily work lives. Employee experience is influenced by various factors such as physical workspace, technology, work-life balance, and organizational culture.

While employee engagement focuses on the commitment and connection employees have with the organization, employee experience encompasses the broader aspects of an employee's interactions and experiences within the workplace. For the purposes of this competency, we will treat Engagement as a component of the overall experience.  

"Ultimately, it’s about a workplace approach that ensures employees are committed to their company goals and values, motivated to contribute to success and able to enhance their own sense of wellbeing."

The Employee Experience is the journey an employee takes with your organization. It includes every interaction that happens during the employee life cycle, plus the experiences that involve an employee's role, workspace, manager and wellbeing. It is the way the people in an organization perceive the way they are treated, enabled, and supported by their organization and how they interact with the physical workspace, culture, technology, processes, and other touch points. It often pivots around a shared sense of purpose and about removing sources of stress and friction.

![Employee Experience Lifecycle Diagram](media/microsoft365-maturity-model--employee-experience/EE%20employee%20lifecycle%20diagram.png)

There are good reasons for organizations to focus on Employee Experience. Positive experiences are associated with better productivity, lower absenteeism, higher quality, and better internal and external relationships. It results in better staff retention, faster and better recruitment, more rapid onboarding of new employees and creates positive feedback into the organizational culture.  

Traditionally, technology has had little purposeful impact on Employee Experience (other than sometimes causing stress and friction) beyond communication. However, cloud technologies and productivity platforms have now emerged with the ability to contribute to positive Employee Experience, provide mature insights and metrics, enable new forms of connection and support strategic purpose and personal growth.  occurs that it directly impacts and informs organizational Employee Experience and Engagement. This competency considers the broad principles of Employee Experience and the characteristics at the 5 levels of maturity.

## Scope of this competency

The Employee Experience competency considers what approaches and tools organizations must create an effective working environment, translating leadership intent and business needs into employee alignment and performance. This strongly interacts with organizational culture and the experience employees have throughout their employment.

This extends to strategy, leadership, vision, objectives, tracked performance measures, communication and culture management.

Employee Experience can include:

- Wellbeing
- Diversity, equality, inclusion & belonging.
- Standards, values & culture  
- Organizational, technical and personal support  
- Accessibility
- Equipment quality, availability and provisioning
- Safety, Environment, Comfort, Facilities
- Performance management and career progression
- Celebration of success
- 360° communication
- Cross-team interaction
- Training and performance management
- Team days and social activities  
...and many other elements

It is useful to categorize Employee Experience into 4 sub-competencies:  

- Connection
- Insight
- Growth
- Purpose

![Employee Experience Sub-Competency Diagram](media/microsoft365-maturity-model--employee-experience/EE%20sub-competency%20diagram.png)

## Evolution of this competency

### Level 100 - Initial

This is the starting level for a new or dysfunctional organization. Strategy may appear to be absent; plans lack consistency or conviction and staff and leadership operate with a sense of unease or evident chaos characterized by firefighting and tension.

**[Initial level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-100---initial)** characteristics include:

#### Connection (100)

- User experience is not considered.
- Organizational communication is sporadic, single-channeled and not repeated.
- There is little sense of camaraderie.
- Staff do not feel supported or valued. Many feel excluded or marginalized.
- Personal feedback focuses on the issues; praise is rarely or sincerely - given.
- Equipment, processes, line management and progression tend to feel rushed, ad hoc and changeable.

#### Insight (100)

- Staff express feelings of fear, confusion, extreme frustration or disenchantment; there is limited team cohesion.
- There are no mechanisms to provide feedback to management, nor do management seek this.
- The organization lacks any knowledge of employee satisfaction, engagement or pain points.
- Line-reporting or top-down/organization-wide, communication and direction are sporadic, ad hoc and inconsistent.
- Employee analytics are not captured or used.

#### Growth (100)

At this level you can expect the following:

- There are limited examples of innovation.
- There is little or no training of either staff or managers.
- Processes and objectives for improving skills, competence and knowledge are absent; up-skilling by motivated staff is not recognized or rewarded.
- There is no attempt to capture, curate and share individual or organization knowledge and know-how.
- Employees are not encouraged to request training or to seek new challenges.
- Knowledge and best practice are not actively shared. Some staff are highly protective of their own knowledge and do not willingly share it with others.
- 'Water-cooler' meetings for informal knowledge exchange and peer to peer are seen as a distraction of non-productive time and are discouraged.

#### Purpose (100)

- Staff are unclear about their purpose and end goals. They do not know what is expected of them or what ‘good’ looks like.
No clear vision or mission has been formulated or communicated. Leadership may have tacit clarity; this is not understood by staff.
- Culture is not considered and is purely an emergent property of the company.
- Staff do not have a sense of what company standards of behavior, appearance and working practices should be. Unprofessional and even unacceptable behavior is not acted on by management.
- Objectives are not formalized.
- Management seems to have conflicting priorities and there is often interdepartmental ‘gamesmanship’ and rivalries.
- Day-to-day activities are highly task driven, requiring extensive supervision and micro-management.
- Business and personal objectives are either absent or applied in ad hoc, changeable and ephemeral ways.
- The business lacks focus & fails to prioritize, or changes focus too rapidly to be effective. Alternatively, activities may be too rigidly enforced, preventing adaptation.
- Little is done to create a positive working environment, to accommodate physical, emotional or well-being needs.  
- Accessibility needs are not considered; this includes a lack of provision for dyslexia, visual or physical impairment or other physiological needs. Even things like access to beverages, toilets, light, warmth and fresh air are variable or not actively considered. There may be safety implications. No one seems to be responsible or accountable for these.
- Workstations, cubicles, and desk spaces are inconsistent and inefficient or inappropriate. Equipment and tools are frequently defective, and no one actively resolves this.

#### Impacts 100

Organizations at this level often have high proportions of disengaged and unsatisfied staff, whether this is outwardly apparent or not. Staff turnover is high, productivity is poor and there are frequent HR issues to manage. Staff leaving the business is a constant drain on its capabilities.

A high proportion of management time is spent dealing with disengagement rather than growth.

Toxic personalities and individuals are not addressed, leading to staff disengagement, absence and exits.

There is often high absenteeism.

### Level 200 - Managed

There are efforts to ensure that the company strategy is trickled down to staff. The strategy may lack clarity or resonance with employees, or may not be translated into actions they feel they can engage in. There is a sense of 'in this together' but it is characterized by fighting against the issues rather than pulling towards the goals. Managers have an understanding that staff should have good experiences and gel as a team but are unclear how to achieve this.

**[Managed level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-200---managed)** characteristics include:

#### Connection (200)

- There are attempts at informing, including and inspiring staff through briefings and email communication. These tend to be one way. Absent staff hear about what was said second hand and from a variety of sources.  
- Organizational news tends to be published on the website but not internally.
- Team members tend to support each other, often in the face of adversity. They socialize, share insights and develop friendships.
- 'Bad actors' often cause frustration and discontent; active intervention to address this is sporadic.
- The needs of some staff are not adequately addressed and there are observable biases and discrimination.
- Staff lack trust in leadership, other teams and some colleagues. There are no established tools or processes to allow multiway dialog between colleagues or between staff and leadership, to share and build on ideas or establish communities of interest and expertise.
- There are processes for providing equipment and other work tools, but these do not always feel fair or effective, favoring seniority rather than need.

#### Insight (200)

- A minority of staff say they are actively engaged in surveys.
- Staff sometimes feel uncertain, frustrated or excluded, often because they do not know why decisions, especially about them and their roles, have been made.  
- There are occasional attempts to gather staff feedback about employee satisfaction, engagement and possible improvements via surveys and a suggestion box. Many managers solicit feedback and insights from staff, but co-ordination with other managers is limited and ad hoc. There is a lack of consistency in this and in the ability or commitment to act on it.
- Managers are encouraged to adopt effective line-management approaches, one-to-one and regular team meetings. Active encouragement and mentoring may be included in these.
- Staff and managers are concerned for the well-being of their staff, but often lack the knowledge of how best to intervene.
- Some managers consider employee workload, activities and team composition. Some experiment with skills & capability assessment and team profiles & dynamics.

#### Growth (200)

At this level you can expect the following:

- Training is unstructured, inconsistent, and largely left to line managers.  
- Managers are rarely trained to be effective supervisors and leaders; they are expected to learn on the job.
- Employees are tacitly expected to take the lead when they are ready to develop new skills or for new challenges and then approach their managers for training, secondment, promotion etc.
- There are some attempts in some teams to share knowledge and best practice. There is little to drive adoption of this and most attempts fall into disuse or have limited impact.
- Individual objectives prioritize business needs, not personal development.
- Staff are expected to learn on the job without having access to specific learning resources. Many staff willingly give their time, but this impacts their own productivity without this necessarily being recognized by their line-management.
- Some individuals may be picked out for mentorships and development.
- Some communities of interest emerge spontaneously, largely with organizational support.
- 'Water-cooler' meetings for informal knowledge exchange and peer to peer learning do occur but are seen as eating into work time in many cases.  

#### Purpose (200)

- Management is conscious of culture and attempt to articulate it. There is some attempt to create coherent values or principles in the business.
- The organization publishes some form of strategy, vision and/or mission, but this tends to be confused, unapproachable, idealistic or appear unrealistic and unachievable.
- Objectives are mostly in place, but may not be consistent, tracked or linked to organizational needs.
- There are 1-to- 1 sessions between managers and staff, though these may be sporadic, lack structure and lack clarity on the purpose of the meetings.
- Equipment and tools that are not fit for purpose or are faulty are slow to be replaced or repaired.
- Managers and colleagues do what they can to address failures in behavior and professional standards; though they are not exactly clear what the organization’s standards are, relying on their personal values.

#### Impacts 200

Staff, and customers, rarely are negative about the organization, though there is still a need to manage negative impressions that impact recruitment and customer relationships.

Staff may attempt to make proactive improvements, though these initiatives often use up valuable resource and staff energy without achieving their goals.

Collaboration and peer support begins to improve productivity, though lacks consistency and remains fragile.  

The organization begins to recognize that positive impacts are related to the changes they are making.  

### Level 300 - Defined

The organization understands the key drivers of Employee Experience.

**[Defined level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-300---defined)** characteristics include:

#### Connection (300)

Tools are in place, including an intranet and other portals which act as hubs or gateways to news, communication, information and connection between staff. This is consistent, regular but not personalized and not always up-to-date. Some members of the leadership team provide updates in the form of blogs or other reflections and staff are enabled to add comments to these.

There are useful tools and processes to allow multiway dialog between colleagues or between staff and leadership, to share and build on ideas. There are active communities of interest and expertise.

Staff briefings are captured and can be accessed, sometimes in video form, after the initial briefing. Questions can be raised by staff after the briefings and communications.  

The structure of the company is published and maintained. Staff are encouraged to update their profiles, with interests and skill areas as well as such personal information as they are comfortable with, and to engage in communities of interest.

The need for inclusiveness is recognized and this is reflected in attempts to ensure accessibility standards are met, that day to day work related needs can be catered for; there isn’t an assumption that 'one size fits all'.

A collaborative work environment is encouraged that promotes teamwork, cross-functional collaboration. Competitive or ‘us and them’ behavior is frowned upon.
There is a palpable sense of belonging and pride in the organization. There are mechanisms for identifying and reporting disruptive behaviors.  

The organization recognizes that experience doesn’t end when they leave, and the act of leaving is treated as a positive for all involved.

The organization understands its values and expected behaviors; it attempts to recruit and develop staff based on these; policies and standards support them.

There are frequent, purposeful 1-to-1 sessions between managers and staff. There is some involvement of staff in decision making.

The importance of recognizing and appreciating employees’ efforts is tacitly and visibly acted upon. There may be reward programs, employee of the month or other forms of recognition, though these are not consistent or analyzed across functions. There are active attempts to avoid exclusion and to eliminate all forms of discrimination. Staff feel fairly treated.

Processes for providing equipment and other work tools are regarded as reasonably fair and appropriate. They operate in a timely fashion to provide people get what they need with little delay.

Staff trust their leadership for the most part, though aren’t always clear about why certain decisions are made.

### Insight (300)

- Surveys that gather feedback on a range of employee engagement, satisfaction and attitudes are regularly published. The results of these and attendant actions are shared.
Feedback, suggestions box processes and a range of 360° feedback options are in place and actively promoted.

They generally feel informed about organization decisions and can discuss changes to their roles and teams. Staff have opportunities to receive support and clarity when they feel uncertain, frustrated or excluded. 

Staff absences and sickness, staff turnover and other metrics are monitored; both line-management and HR act on this via a consistent process.  

Managers use feedback and insights from staff and discuss their observations and seek advice from their peers as well as with HR. This includes staff performance and well-being and related ‘soft’ measures. 

There are a range of tools, including workplace analytics, staff profile models (DiSC, Myers-Briggs etc.) that are used, though these tend to be driven by intermittent initiatives and may not be consistently applied.  

Staff skills & capability are assessed and fed into learning and growth activities. 

Individuals also have access to tools and workplace analytics to enable them to make decisions about their approaches, balance or priorities.  

Staff are allowed to take breaks, reserve focus time and decline meetings when needed and appropriate.  

Growth (300) 

At this level you can expect the following: 

There are policies and programs for staff skills development and staff records that capture this. 

Key staff have regular training appropriate to their roles and development. Not everyone accesses this or understands the benefits. 

Line managers are expected to improve their management & leadership abilities. 

Employees have opportunities to play to personal strengths, to be successful, to grow, develop new skills and take on new challenges. 

There are attempts at disseminating knowledge, best practice and experience, though these are only partly systematized. 

Learning and growth begin to appear in individual objectives, mostly at the instigation of individuals and managers. 

There are attempts to make it easy for staff to learn on the job and easily find the knowledge, resources and expertise they need on demand. 

There are some programs to introduce individual and organizational growth through networking, mentorships, and communities. 

Stories are increasingly used to communicate knowledge and to establish culture and values. 

Interactive Frequently Asked Question tools allow open requests for knowledge and provide timely responses.  

‘Water-cooler’ meetings, ‘non-purposeful’ get-togethers and ‘fika’ breaks encourage knowledge exchange and peer to peer learning. 

 

Purpose (300) 

There is active promotion of company ethos and values and a tangible culture in line with this. Executive vision and strategy link to these. This is measured via some feedback from staff and external contacts. 

Staff understand and value the organization’s vision and principles, as well as accountability. 

Opportunities to contribute to Vision. 

There are well-established company standards and staff are expected to adhere to them. 

Equipment and workplace are of good quality and maintained in reasonable condition. Faults are rectified when notified.  

Personal SMART objectives are consistently in place. They are tracked via line management but are only tenuously linked to organizational needs and are not integrated across teams. 

The importance of ‘First Impressions count’ is recognized and attempts are made to provide a positive pre-employee experience as well as a welcoming and organized onboarding process to set the tone for new hires’ journey with the organization.  

Health and well-being are considered alongside productivity and objectives. 

#### Impacts 300

Staff, and customers, are advocates for the organization, leading to improved recruitment.

They take initiative, and they are proactive, including taking responsibility for their own development.  

They hold themselves accountable for delivering on their promises.  

They work collaboratively and synergistically with other team members.  

The organization begins to see positive impacts on areas like profitability, productivity, efficiency, quality, creativity, safety, compliance, employee well-being, and staff retention.  

### Level 400 - Predictable

**[Predictable level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-400---predictable)** characteristics include:

#### Lifecycle Management

- Content Lifecycle Management is in active use in all regulated or quality assured processes and elsewhere that has impacts on the business. Most documents are tagged with sensitivity, status and retention information or reside in a location where this is enforced.
- All types of content have similar levels of management:
  - List items have version control, retention, deletion etc. at the item level.
  - Media files are managed in the same way as documents, with metadata, reviews and lifecycles. They are linked to associated assets, such as transcriptions and related media and lifecycle management applies to both the components and the content sets.
  - Email items are actively managed and redirected into other types of content or messaging as part of a comprehensive content management approach
  - Publication and removal schedules are applied to web pages and news items. Retained web pages are regularly reviewed to ensure they remain up to date and useful/relevant. They are actively linked to related content, with these links dynamically updating as the related content changes, is created or removed.
- Document management capabilities are designed into repositories to be compliant with lifecycle policies. Most content is based on managed content types; these include definitions of the template, identification metadata, lifecycle and disposition markers, status and other policies by default.
- File servers and local file systems are not in general use except where there is a documented need.
- There is active, managed removal of content from managed content areas in accordance with policies and staff are responsible for ongoing "decluttering" and organization of collaboration and personal content. Controls and monitoring are in place and used to review these activities, though typically without automation or strong enforcement.

- Multi-author content creation and editing is the norm and extends beyond organization boundaries to incorporate suppliers, partners and clients where appropriate and with well understood and monitored security and governance (such as use of time windows for editability). Use of email attachments is the exception within the company and is in decline with external content sharing.
- Duplication of content is actively avoided and there are periodic checks to identify unnecessary duplicates. There is good understanding of version control and version history, and these are appropriately used.
- Role-based access, governance and protection is well designed, documented and consistently implemented.
- Document Retention mechanisms are in -lace for all important classes of content and are reviewed annually to ensure policies and technical controls are effective and appropriate. attempted, sporadically. A governance board reviews new needs and oversees decisions on retention, disposition and destruction of content.
- Schema exist for common list types, often based on open standards, to ensure consistency and interoperability. Extensions to schema are carefully considered, reviewed against other schema in use and rolled out in an integrated way that updates all dependent lists.
- Content classes are developed based on the agreed schema.

:::image type="content" source="media/microsoft365-maturity-model--management-of-content/lifecycle-management-level-400b.jpg" alt-text="Lifecycle Management - Level 400b":::

##### Identification

- There are standard content categories and these are widely used to group and tag content, aiding in search and productivity. A standard set of consistent content statuses, classifications and other business wide approaches to naming and identifying content are in place. There is some automation of tagging and classification.
- "Content classes" are widely in use and there are processes for creating new classes as needed.

##### Presentation

- There is an active process for updating templates across the organization to ensure they are up to date, fit for purpose and support brand and style guidelines
- Emails have automated footers, with role-based variants and active insertion of content in support of campaigns and other business communication needs.
- Documents are carefully structured, with consistent use of semantic elements such as headings, default styling, insertable standard content and images. They are designed to support appropriate and effective presentation of content (i.e. the purpose of the document defines the style of the document) while supporting accessibility guidelines, effective search and other busines needs. Staff are well versed in use of these and use them consistently.
- Staff are familiar with best practice across a wide range of content creation. Presentation and management and actively skilled for the needs within their role.
- Regionalization is actively addressed and implemented through templates, configuration and policy. There are processes for identifying errors and inconsistencies and flagging these for action
- Custom and industry dictionaries are deployed to users" computers. There is a process for correcting and updating these.
- Standard media and content libraries are commonly used; there is centralized management of core tags and information architecture used for identification, classification and management.
- Tagging and topics allow systems to recommend content to users.
- Lists employ dynamic formatting, layouts and views to highlight important insights and to aid both item level and aggregated use, comprehension and insights.
- List items are actively used across the content management environment, acting as data sources, lookups and choice field content. Changes are managed and dynamically update other content

##### Storage

- There is a comprehensive storage strategy supported by a well-designed platform for almost all forms of enterprise content. This encompasses "business-personal", collaborative, operational and corporate content as well as the continuum from ad hoc and temporary content to persistent or long-term content. Strong signposting, guidance, and automation aid staff in how to adhere to the strategy and therefore put content in the right "place" n the right way. Content management strategies are well understood and are robust, with staff understanding and compliance monitored. File Server are employed for very specific purposes and not for general content use.
- Centralized storage areas are carefully structured, providing rapid and clear access to managed assets, publication and resource areas across the organization; permissions and security are strongly managed and monitored without limiting productivity. Folder use is rare and appropriate.
- Access permissions are as granular as needed, applying to entire content repositories and/or to individual items and often extend outside the organization to accommodate suppliers, partners and clients with the same level of fidelity and control.
- Email storage growth has plateaued.

#### Impacts

At this level you can expect the following:

- Content is strongly managed across business applications and processes, feels largely seamless to users and is easy for them to recognize value in and adopt. Staff focus on task completion, contributing to content management consistently, recognizing that their contributions benefit other parts of the system.
- In many cases, content storage is a function of the type of content and not at the discretion of staff; ["putability"](glossary.md#putability) decisions are driven by well-established principles that staff are fluent at applying.
- Productivity is consistently high and metrics are in place to identify and act on exceptions. Rework and errors are rare.
- Staff intuitively use definitive reference content; they know how to validate that they are using appropriate information and are collectively confident of decisions based on their sources.
- Content driven systems are routinely improved; feedback and monitoring mechanisms at granular and aggregate level continuously identify areas for improvement and enable programs of work to maintain productivity as the business landscape evolves.
- Staff and managers are able to focus on their objectives and are rarely interrupted or frustrated by the quality and accessibility of the content they need or create.

### Level 500 - Optimizing

**[Optimizing level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-500---optimizing)** characteristics include:

#### Lifecycle Management

- Content Lifecycle Management operates at most levels of the organization, is optimized, tracked and reviewed for effectiveness and actively drives quality, productivity and risk reduction – this may be reflected in certifications, standards and reduced insurance costs. It remains consistent as it spans different types of content and platform.
- Most content is created based on well-defined and managed "content classes or content types. There is visibility of use of content types across the organization and an understanding of the content type schema and inheritance.
- Linkages between types of content are respected, retaining referential integrity, to ensure that changes at a granular (item, file or document) level do not cause a degradation to sets or collections of content.

- Content tagging for classification, access, sensitivity, status and retention is widely automated as are relationships between content.
- Retention policies are actively managed and tested. Unmanaged documents are the exception. Document Retention is applied to almost all content, including items in lists, emails other non-file types of content.
- Policies and technical controls are actively updated in response to changing needs and regulatory and business landscape.
- Default removal policies and notifications drive broad compliance and clutter avoidance. Removal of content is largely automated.
- Metrics describe the entire content position across multiple dimensions including status, usage, value and more.
- Highly efficient, flexible and productive approaches to the entire content lifecycle are the norm and encompass almost all the organizations actions and interactions.
- External organizations are actively assisted in achieving robust levels of maturity. Email attachments are rare.
- Proactive deduplication is in place. Potential duplicates are identified at the point of content creation.
- Role-based access, governance and protection are deeply embedded in processes and are designed with minimal "friction" for the task or process.
- Live, multi-author use of content via links, active discovery and graph-based personalization is the norm, ensuring content remains live, up to date and relevant.
 
:::image type="content" source="media/microsoft365-maturity-model--management-of-content/lifecycle-management-level-500.jpg" alt-text="Lifecycle Management - Level 500":::

##### Identification

- Content categorization is largely automated; existing content is analyzed on an ongoing basis to apply tagging and labelling in order to ensure that new context, topics, classes and policies are applied dynamically as these emerge in the business.
- Images, other media and related content are automatically suggested for inclusion based on tags, context and insights from "the graph" of the organization.
- "Content classes" are the norm for almost all content. Externally sourced content is likewise assigned to a class and tagged.

##### Presentation

- Content creation is based on full managed, automated templates, with significant degrees of automatic content completion, content suggestions, AI assistance or a "wizard" based creation process.
- Emails have dynamic, role, risk and context driven footers.
- Fully semantic documents are in widespread use, with quality control and testing. Poorly structured and presented documents are identified and addressed. Accessibility is strongly supported, and documents are frequently optimized to support other automated processes, little human input. Automatic content review checks for style, consistency, grammar and tone of voice, sentiment and possible data loss.
- Media and other elements are strongly standardized, classified and published. Images are automatically tagged for accessibility. AI automation may suggest suitable media for insertion into content.
- Video content is automatically tagged, with audio transcripts also being generated where appropriate.
- Best practice, Regionalization, productivity aids including dictionaries, thesauruses, knowledge-lookups etc. are embedded across the organization. External organizations are influenced to adopt content management approaches. These are dynamically adjusted to meet the needs of the member of staff accessing the content.
- Lists can be automatically created from list templates employing standard schema and deployed on demand. These include consistent dynamic formatting, layouts and views.
- Other applications can update list content dynamically.

##### Storage

- There is a wide reaching, flexible and inclusive strategy for storage of all types of content which ensures everything is available to staff and partners who need it, regardless of location, device, region etc. ["Putability"](glossary.md#putability) is actively guided or fully automated, based on AI classifiers.
- Storage is largely "invisible" to staff. Content is created, stored and accessed without a need to learn the storage structures.
- There are effectively no limits to the volume of storage or type of content that can be stored and accessed.

#### Impacts

At this level you can expect the following:

- Content is proactively managed and monitored across all business applications and processes. The user experience is seamless and feels fluid to staff, with minimal silos or boundaries to negotiate. Staff focus on task completion, often without having to actively contribute to content management due to high degrees of automation and embedding of content management in content processes. Staff are actively willing to undertake some content management tasks, Pay It Forward is intuitively accepted.
- Content storage predominantly a function of the content type and the process. Staff rarely concern themselves with where to store anything or how to retrieve it.
- Productivity is maintained at a high level through active interventions and a cycle of continuous improvement based on data driven insights. Statistical methods monitor for out of bounds errors and exceptions and ensure content errors and exceptions are systematically eliminated.
- Unreliable content and information sources are actively improved or eliminated. AI monitoring continually assesses content quality and suggests improvements and interventions.
- The organization can respond rapidly to changes, dynamically repurposing content, amending tagging, labelling etc. to meet new scenarios.

## Scenarios

The company needs to manage its staff and process policies in order to remain complaint and ensure staff only work to the latest version of each.

The sales team need to issue new quotations and access previously issued versions, similar quotations for other clients and different quotations to the same client. These need to have consistent layouts and information.

Company vision and values need to be updated and communicated across the company, with previous versions removed.

Financial and HR documents need to be retained for legal purposes.

Project teams need to be able to access all documents related to a project and understand their status.

Information Governance need to ensure that all sensitive information is identified and not shared externally.

Marketing wants to ensure all internal and external documents use the new company logo, colors and mission statement.

Staff need to know where to store the product specification information, QA reports and analysis data for a new product. They also need to update the new product pipeline overview for the sales and marketing teams.

## Conclusion

Management of Content remains a challengingly broad and deep competency for organizations to address. It is vital that the broad concept of content is incorporated into any content strategies, to ensure that approaches are not limited to just documents.

Equally, many organizations invest in file storage technologies that provide performance and security, but do not address the regulatory and legal obligations around sensitivity, compliance and retention/disposal. Equally, the corrosive effects of clutter, inconsistency, poor presentation and clear identification of content at all levels is overlooked, with attendant impacts on productivity and risk.

Burgeoning automation and AI make achieving high levels of maturity realistic for most organizations; however, the fundamentals need to be put in place before these can be effectively deployed.
