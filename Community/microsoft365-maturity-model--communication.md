# The Microsoft 365 Maturity Model - Collaboration Competency

## Overview of the Concepts [tl;dr]

Communication is a core competency of a successful modern organization. Most organizations want to be sure their population is well-informed about strategic direction, operational initiatives, cultural mores and norms, and the like. However, many organizations fall short. Knowledge in the board room must get to the mail room, and this competency focuses of the levels of maturity which organizations historically fall into.

## Definition of this competency

Communication is generally defined as a smaller number of people extending information to a larger group of people. This is most commonly the model for Intranet sites in SharePoint, Yammer groups, or organization-wide Teams.

The content itself can take many forms, such as News Posts, discussions about broad topics, blog posts, benefits descriptions, etc. It can also encompass high importance alerts and notifications, possibly with feedback and tracking.

Communication Professionals will sometimes refer to the 7 Principles of Communication; these might be worth considering alongside your maturity assessment.

### Attention and Style

In good communication, the receiver’s attention is drawn to the message. People are different in behavior, attention, emotions etc. so they may respond differently to the message. This may require constructing different message formats for different roles and grades. Senior staff should be seen to be acting in accordance with the messages, using the messaging tools and supporting the messaging processes. Formal communication is generally used for transmitting messages and other information; however, sometimes informal communication may prove more effective. Informal communication can be helpful for assessing the reaction of employees towards various policies. Both types should embrace the organization’s ethos; commonly this is positive, honest, respectful, open and polite.

### Coherency

Communication often takes place across multiple tools/formats and over a period of time. It’s important that communication remains logical, well-planned, and self-reinforcing across these. There should be a good connection with the main topic and, often linked to company values, principles, and mission. Equally, communication should be consistent with the policies, plans, programs and objectives of the organization and not in conflict with them.

### Clarity

The purpose of messages should be clear; worded in such a way that the receiver understands the same thing which the sender wants to convey. Be clear of what format do you want to say it in. Be clear about your goal or purpose. It is also essential that the receiver is conversant with the language, inherent assumptions, and the mechanics of communication. Typically, sentences should be short, in the active voice and key elements stated it in separate bullet points.

### Feedback

Feedback is very important to make the communication effective. There should be a feedback information from the recipient to know whether he has understood the message in the same sense in which the sender has meant it.

### Effective

Communications shouldn’t leave your team confused. You need to communicate your message in the least possible words, have the consistency of tone, voice, and content so that you can save time. There is no room for repetition. Try to use short sentences and short words. Each message must have a logical conclusion and a call to action. People shouldn’t be left wondering if there is more to come. Make sure you communicate completely that includes the need to be informed and take action. 
The information communicated should be adequate and complete in all respects. Inadequate information may delay action and create confusion. Inadequate information also affects efficiency of the receiver.

### Timeliness and Urgency

Communication should be done at proper time and with the appropriate level of impact and urgency, to ensure that messages can be understood and acted upon to achieve their objective. It should be possible to differentiate Urgent and Import information and understand the time scale for any actions. There should be confidence that communication reaches their audience when intended.

## Common Microsoft 365 tool sets

Every organization can choose how best to use the Microsoft 365 platform for communication. The best answer for a large multi-national conglomerate would make little sense for a five-person financial advisory firm. The Microsoft 365 apps and services most likely included in the mix for communication include the following:

- SharePoint Communication Sites
- SharePoint News / News Digests
- Stream
- Yammer
- Yammer in Teams
- Sway
- Email

### Level 100

The entry point for the Communication competency is often simply a set of documents in a SharePoint Document Library. These documents are most commonly organized into folders by topics, and the folders may be 5-7 layers deep. This is usually the first step in moving from a shared folders environment to a Web-based environment.

Characteristics include:

- Navigation & taxonomy not formally considered
- Little to no review/governance of content
- Folder structure re-created from shared drives and all content housed in documents only
- Content is presented without appropriate structure or context
- No holistic view of permissions

As with all 100 level characteristics, the practices may be somewhat effective, but they don’t take advantage of the power of the platform, nor do they take into account the multiple use cases which exist in even the smallest and simplest organization. These use cases generally include:

- New employees joining the organization and getting up to speed
- Sureness about the validity of the document one finds in a search

The initial level is characterized by heavy use of email to circulate information, updates, newsletters and attached documents.  Documents may also be stored in shared file storage and there may be use of intranet pages or campaigns to reinforce circulated information.

- Most communications are untargeted or weakly targeted to intended audiences
- Minimal feedback mechanisms are available for the communications. Tracking for readership is absent.
- Communications are frequently ad hoc, not based on templates, lack governance and do not tend towards an agreed ‘house’ style.
- High impact communications lack a review and approval process.
- There is no means of prioritizing important communications, not of scheduling their availability

### Level 200

Characteristics include:

- Custom metadata is applied to content
- Templates standardized across sites
- Lists used rather than static HTML
- Multiple document management systems may be present w/out governance around purpose and no cross-referencing of content
- Site structure does not only reflect organizational structure
Repeatable level Communication characteristics include:
- Use of templates for messages, newsletters, documents
- Example ‘tone of voice’ guidance, reinforcement of company values and phrases (including mission statements)
- Standardized images and logos (stored in a shared location)
- More than a single method of pushing communication to internal users
- Publication of key messages to an intranet or other persistent system for later retrieval.
- Some mechanisms for feedback or further interaction resulting from communications.
- Nominated functions for reviewing/creating/releasing some classes of communications, i.e. nominated comms roles
- Ability to schedule future communications
- Some degree of targeting, based on groups and distribution lists
- A policy is available to guide users on appropriate communications and there are mechanisms to support this

### Level 300

Characteristics include:

- Site Columns/ Managed Metadata standardize the taxonomy. Custom Content Types are created.  
- Custom page layouts & site templates are configured
- Approval process is implemented
- Navigation provides strong information scent to complete top tasks
- Some content targeted to groups
- Mobile access considered
- Content management is decoupled from content presentation
Defined level Communication characteristics include:
- The purpose of different types of communication are considered and understood and appropriate strategies are defined for different categories and constraints.
- Communications policies are published and widely understood; some monitoring and reinforcement is in place

### Level 400

Characteristics include:

- Content is displayed in as many locations as needed, in the proper context
- Content life cycle management ensures accuracy, freshness, and uniqueness
- Site usage informs the content presented
- Content, across varying media file types, are stored in appropriate services within Microsoft 365
- Organizational Assets are used to centralize imagery, iconography
- If more than one doc management system is present, governance is defined
- Content written for the web, formatted to support online reading patterns

### Level 500

Characteristics include:

- Content is personalized to the user
- Content is shared across multiple functions and systems without duplication
- Feedback mechanism is in place and evaluated to improve content over time
- Automated tagging may be present
- Messages are (automatically) translated to the reader’s language
- Tagging and other use of company terminology is enforced.
- There may be explicit linkage to vision, values and mission statements
- Messages can be acknowledged and optionally commented upon. Actions can be seamlessly transferred to individual or user tasks
