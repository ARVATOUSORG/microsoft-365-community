# CDS and Model-Driven Apps Standards and Naming Conventions

In any technology or programming language, there are generally accepted better practices when it comes to naming conventions, thinking about data structures, etc. It's no different with the Power Platform. Even if you are the lone person working on a solution, future you will appreciate following some consistent standards. If you are a part of a team, then that team should agree on a set of standards.

This article outlines some suggested approaches to naming conventions and how to think about bringing that consistency to your solutions. Treat it as a set of suggestions which, when followed, will lead to more maintainable and consistent solutions. However, it's also a set of suggestions, so feel free to take this set of suggestions and adapt it for your own use.
