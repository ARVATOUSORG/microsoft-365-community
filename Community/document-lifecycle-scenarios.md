# Document Lifecycle Scenarios

[!INCLUDE [content-disclaimer](includes/content-disclaimer.md)]

Not all documents are created equal. Based on the relative weight and importance of a document, we may decide on quite different ways to manage a document through its lifecycle. In this article, we present several different scenarios for managing a document lifecycle.

No one of these scenarios will be appropriate for all of your documents. Instead, you should consider this a set of potential options as you think through your own document life cycles. One or more of these scenarios may be adaptable to your specific needs.

## *Ad hoc* Document Becoming Permanent

When smaller teams of people work together in Microsoft Teams, they frequently come up with "chunks" of content spread across Files, OneNote, posts, Wiki pages, etc. As the ideas gel, those chunks need to be assembled into more complete documents, whether for sharing with the entire organization, a customer, or perhaps management.

## Personal Thoughts Turning into Organizational Document

This scenario is similar to the inner and outer loop ideas presented by Microsoft over the last few years.

## Important Organizational Document

Some documents are simply too important organizationally to arise informally. They also may require some organized and sometimes mandated processes.
